In the Ruth community, Mount Oak and Frontier Roads were hardest hit where a cinder block/cement home was nearly wiped clean.  Debris from a home on Frontier Road was thrown 50 to 100 yards away.  A family of 9 was in this house and 5 were killed. A trailer was missing and a metal-bolted garage was wiped clean of its foundation.  Along Frontier Road, a large brick home was nearly wiped clean off its foundation with several large trees ripped out of the ground and missing.  Further northeast along the path, along Walnut Ridge, a one-story home was severely damaged with the roof missing and a trailer that was tossed into a tree.  Several concrete power poles were bent over as the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 231, some bent at the base.  One the east side of Highway 231, a gas station building was completely demolished and two gas pumps were ripped from the ground and missing. The canopy over the pumps remained mostly intact.||The tornado continued toward Union Grove.  The degree of damage weakened somewhat but several homes had significant damage where the top stories and roofs were destroyed and the external walls had collapsed.  Along County Road 240, a double-wide manufactured home was destroyed and a large garage collapsed but the well-built roof remained intact.||The tornado significantly weakened as it crossed the Tennessee River.  On the other side of the river, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees as it crossed Walker Road and just across U.S. Highway 431 before lifting just northeast of Highway 431.","A powerful storm system roared across the Southeast United States on Wednesday, April 27, 2011.

Within a two mile corridor of either side of the railroad tracks the damage was significant. Within this corridor, several well constructed houses were destroyed.  Along Bonner Street, multiple block homes were leveled to the ground with the block foundations destroyed.  A twenty-five foot section of pavement was sucked up and scattered. Chunks of the pavement were found in a home over 1/3 of a mile down the road. The damage in this area was consistent with EF-5 damage. ||In addition, at least three churches along the path sustained significant damage.   One church in Phil Campbell was completely destroyed with only the slab remaining.||Multiple mobile homes throughout the path were completely destroyed, and their mangled frames were tossed 25 to 50 yards.  Cars were tossed and destroyed throughout the path of the tornado, with one car wrapped around a debarked tree in Phil Campbell.   All along the path length, thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped.  Hundreds of trees were also debarked and twisted, and had only stubs of the largest branches remaining.  EF-5 damage continued similarly northeast from Phil Campbell, roughly along County Roads 81 and 82 toward the community of Oak Grove.||In Oak Grove, the tornado may have reached a relative maximum in intensity well into the EF-5 category as the damage was slightly more intense and the path width was at a maximum of greater than one mile.  A large swath of complete devastation was noted in Oak Grove along County Roads 38 and Smith Lane.  A large well-constructed home with extensive anchoring was razed with debris carried well away from the site.  A Corvette sports car was mangled and thrown 641 feet (measured). A block home next door was also disintegrated.  Along Smith Lane a block home was wiped out and the only remains of a nearby chicken house was a small piece of a metal truss.

Along this line, the tornado passed through Fyffe, Rainsville, Sylvania, and eventually into northern DeKalb County south of the Cartersville community, killing 25 people. On the first day of surveys, the survey team noticed initial damage in the Lakeview community where the path width was generally around 50 yards.  This initial damage included mostly felled and snapped trees and structural damage to small buildings.  Extensive damage was noted especially in Rainsville and Sylvania where the path width was estimated to over 1/2 mile wide.  Damage in Rainsville included houses that were completely removed from foundations, with debris scattered for about one mile.  Near this location, trees were debarked and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris strewn for about a mile downstream.||A narrow corridor of intense damage extended from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road (also known as County Road 180), extending toward County Road 514.  Along Skaggs Road, a stone house was completely obliterated with much of the interior debris strewn well away from the structure.  A supporting large cement stone pillar was ripped completely out of the ground.  Another home along Skaggs Road was also leveled completely to the ground. The NOAA overflight showed significant ground scarring in this area and a walk through the nearby fields showed large pot marks and other sections of disturbed ground. ||Slightly northeast along Lingerfeldt Road, numerous homes were leveled completely to their foundation with vehicles and debris strewn for hundreds of feet.  Overhead photos and follow-up visual confirmation revealed a mangled vehicle tossed well into a ravine and resting up in the remainder of trees.  At  1608 Lingerfeldt Road/County Road 180, a large two story brick home was completely obliterated with several of the supporting anchors ripped of the ground.  A concrete porch was ripped off with pieces strewn up to 150 yards.  A section of the asphalt driveway was pulled up.  In addition, an anchored liberty safe weighing 800 pounds was pulled off its anchorage and thrown into a wooded area 600 feet away.  When found, the safe's door had been ripped open and completely off.  A large pick-up truck at this residence was found mangled in pieces over 250 yards away in the same wooded area.  The residents of the home survived in a nearby storm pit.  Of note, the storm pit was partially exposed by the tornado with dirt being sucked up and pulled away around the opening.  Next door, a mobile home was completely disintegrated.  The residents of the mobile there also survived in a storm pit.  The section of damage from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road near the intersection with Crow Lane was deemed to be EF-5 intensity.   Severe damage with high end EF-4 damage was noted in a corridor from County Road 515 through a neighborhood along County Road 441.  In the east and south ends of the neighborhood, many one and two story homes were leveled to their foundation with debris scattered some distance.  Several cars were thrown a large distance in this area.  There was evidence of ground scarring as well as some sidewalk pavement pulled up in this location.  However, some of the homes in this area appeared to be pushed off their foundation initially with limited anchorage. ||In the Sylvania community, similar situation occurred with houses completely removed from foundations and debris blown far downstream.  Some of these houses were connected to their foundations with anchor bolts and foundation straps, indicating a stronger construction of the homes. ||Tornado damage continued from the Blake community, intersecting County Road 27, running parallel between State Highway 75 and Interstate 59 through Henager, Ider, to south of Cartersville.  ||In the Blake community, the tornado path width was estimated to be one half to three quarters of a mile.

All exterior and interior walls of several homes were completely destroyed with partial block and mortar foundations remaining.  In one instance, a concrete slab that served as a porch was displaced a few feet and broken in half.  Some hardwood trees in the area were stripped with no stubs of any branches remaining and were partially debarked.  The Mountain View Baptist Church sustained significant damage.  An old, one-story portion of the church dating back to 1902 and constructed of a brick and mortar exterior on wood frame walls was completely destroyed.  A recent two-story addition to the church was constructed in 2004 and consisting of similar building materials was partially destroyed, with most exterior walls and nearly all interior walls fallen.

A strong cold front trailed southward from the trough and swept through the state. Ahead of this cold front, an intense derecho moved through central Alabama during the afternoon and evening hours of Monday, March 18th. The morning started out cloudy across Alabama, but as dry air aloft filtered into the state from the southwest, the clouds thinned, allowing surface based instability to increase into the 1250-1750 J/kg range ahead of the developing line of thunderstorms.  As the line entered the state from Mississippi, it brought with it damaging straight line winds of widespread reports of 60 to 80 mph, including a measured report of 88 mph.  These winds resulted in trees and power lines down across the northern two-thirds of central Alabama.  Along with the wind from the derecho, up to two inch hail was reported and eventually a tornado spun up in northern Etowah County. Ahead of the derecho, discrete thunderstorms developed as well. It was within these individual storms where some of the largest hail was reported, including baseball sized hail in Chilton County.",490

The beginning of the damage path appeared to be about 250 yards west of Highway 9 where some light tree damage was noted. More substantial tree damage was noted closer to Highway 9 and along Thelma Road, with numerous snapped or uprooted trees. In addition there was damage to two houses. One had some minor damage to some of the siding and gutters. The other had uplift of some sections of the roof from both the house and a nearby shed. Damage at this location was consistent with estimated peak 3-second wind gusts of around 100 mph based on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Some sporadic tree damage was noted to the northeast of Thelma Road near some farm fields, and it seems likely that the tornado was then in occasional contact with the ground for a little over a mile with only some light tree damage noted. A small corridor of more significant damage was noted again just west of Price Road and about 0.3 miles north of Geneva County Highway 4. At that location, a metal building structure being used as a barn was destroyed. The metal beams that supported the structure were embedded at the corners of the building in about a foot of concrete in the ground. These beams and the associated concrete were pulled out of the ground.  Nearby damage consisted of some sporadic instances of trees and poles being snapped, as well as a small shed being destroyed. Given the likelihood that the wind entered the larger metal structure relatively unimpeded, and a lack of more significant nearby damage, it`s likely that this structure failed at a slightly lower wind speed with estimated peak 3-second wind gusts of around 105 mph.

The tornado then weakened a bit as it moved east through the property, but continued to uproot and snap trees. Debris from upstream damage at the farmstead was also observed scattered about the area, approximately one-half mile downstream. Additional vegetative damage likely occurred as the tornado continued east, while dissipating, to near the Barbour/Russell County line in an area that was inaccessible.","As a strong shortwave trough approached central Alabama from the west a low level southerly jet intensified over the area.

There were three separate notable increases in damage severity and/or density, likely indicating that the funnel had a skipping/cycling characteristic as it swayed from less to more intense.||The tornado touched down along 5th Street North, between Highway 11 and Avenue A, where damage ranged from broken large limbs to uprooted and snapped trees. The tornado then traveled northeast with a long swath of damage centered along a track generally between Interstate 20/59 and Highway 11. Aside from continued uprooting of trees and downing of limbs, the first notable damage occurred just west of Western Hills Mall, where there was hefty damage to an Express Oil Change, Alabama ABC store, and mini strip mall, along Dr. M.L.K. Boulevard. Damage at this location was likely the result of a short-lived, concentrated vortex, with a track around 300 yards in length and EF1 intensity. Beyond this point, damage fell into EF0 range.||The tornado continued knocking down trees as it moved northeast, with some trees falling onto homes, resulting in severe roof damage. Tornadic winds also caused minor to moderate roof damage ranging from missing shingles to sections of roof damaged or blown off, especially in neighborhoods adjacent to Miles College (to the south and northeast). Given a noticeable increase in damage density, it is possible that the tornado briefly intensified in this area, over the course of roughly a 700 yard path. While there was an obvious increase in the amount of uprooted trees, there was a large contribution from shallow root systems and especially saturated soil conditions; thus, given a lack of notable wind-driven damage to homes (which held in EF0, characteristic of shingle and roof trim damage), the overall damage pattern did not tip the scale for a small corridor of EF1 rating.||Next, the tornado neared and crossed Interstate 20/59 where the extent of damage backed off, though some minor structural damage done to the Tire Tech car bay, and Freeway Honda. Windows were also blown out of a few cars at the Honda dealership. An increase in the number of uprooted trees was again observed surrounding Tuxedo Park on the north side of Interstate 20/59, along with roof damage to a few homes.

The tornado quickly intensified and grew wider near the intersection of County Road 42 and County Road 38, where numerous structures sustained damage. The St. James Highland Bible Church lost a significant portion of its metal roof and wooden trusses.  The roof did not appear to be particularly well constructed, and the damage was consistent with winds near 80 mph.  Supporting evidence for the classification of a tornado was quite strong in this location, and debris from the church was thrown northward across the path of the tornado.  Several homes near this location also sustained a loss of shingles and other roof covering materials.  The tornado weakened somewhat as it moved towards downtown Jemison, where falling trees caused significant damage to mobile homes near the intersection of Patton Street and Hotel Street.  As the tornado moved just east of U.S. Highway 31, damage was relatively minor and limited to carports, shingles, and a few uprooted trees.  The tornado dissipated about one quarter mile east of U.S. Highway 31 near Chilton Circle.","A line of thunderstorms moved across Central Alabama during the early morning hours of Wednesday, February 7, 2018.

This tornado was rated EF0 with max winds estimated at 65 mph based on the observed damage.,"For the first time since January 2017, an event including both flooding and tornadoes impacted our area starting on February 11, 2018. Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  One of the tornadoes clipped far southern Houston county.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded. Across southeast Alabama and portions of southwest Georgia, widespread 6 to 8 inches of rain fell. While one Flash Flood Warning was issued, the majority of the impacts from this event were from moderate rainfall rates over a prolonged period of time as convection trained across the tri-state area. These high rainfall totals resulted in numerous road closures across the Florida Panhandle from water covered roads and washed out roadways. In addition, a few roads were closed across southeast Alabama.",268

Further northeast a small portion of a covered drive suffered some uplift of sheathing at North Shelby Baptist Church, where a few trees were snapped or uprooted near the entrance of Belcher Drive. To the east of Highway 280, multiple trees were snapped or uprooted along a portion of Old Highway 280 road near Salser Lane. The tornado tracked north-northeast of this point through uninhabited and inaccessible areas and then reached the Highland Lakes Subdivision where it crossed Highland Lakes Drive and affected areas along Southledge Road. The majority of damage here was due to snapped or uprooted trees though some minor roof damage was noted to a home along Southledge Road. Further northeast along Southledge Road near Ledge Circle, a home lost some shingles and a portion of a backyard fence was downed due to the winds.||The tornado continued northeast and affected some areas along Highland Lakes Trail,|Springhill Lane, Springhill Court, Mountain Trace, and Watersedge Circle. Nearly all of the damage in this area was to uprooted or snapped trees. One home did lose a window likely due to a falling tree. Further northeast the tornado produced tree damage on portions of Knollwood Drive, Watermill Circle, Highland Lakes Trail, Sandhurst Circle, Grove Park Parkway, and Grove Park Circle. Along Grove Park Parkway there was some roof damage to a home along with minor damage to two signs and one street light along the roadway.

A highly-sheared environment combined with increasing instability produced numerous tornadic thunderstorms. Severe parameters were supportive of significant and long-track supercells, prompting the issuance of a rare High Risk Convective Outlook from the Storm Prediction Center for portions of Central Alabama.||A total of 10 tornado tracks were surveyed in Central Alabama. This included 4 EF3 tornadoes, 3 EF2 tornadoes, and 3 EF1 tornadoes. Damage was significant along the paths of the most intense tornadoes and, unfortunately, injuries and fatalities occurred. |Some storms were cyclic, meaning multiple tornadoes were produced by the same storm. The most impressive tornado of the event was the long-track tornado that traveled nearly 80 miles from Hale County to Shelby County.

The tornado began just east of Orrville near the intersection of Highway 22 and Cahaba Road. As it tracked northeast, it intensified and the damage path was nearly parallel with Highway 22. The damage consisted of mainly uprooted trees with some trunks that were snapped. There were also several manufactured homes that sustained roof and some foundation damage. As the tornado continued along Highway 22, additional tree damage was observed as it neared the southwestern sections of Selma.|The tornado quickly intensified as it entered the city limits of Selma, nearly parallel to Highway 22 and West Dallas Avenue. The overall length and damage width in the densely populated neighborhoods had devastating impacts to the city. Many hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped, many onto homes. Most of the softwood trees were snapped about halfway up on the trunks. A daycare center on West Dallas Avenue and Cooper Drive sustained heavy roof and exterior wall damage which was consistent with the higher-end EF2 wind speeds. Some debris rowing was also noted in the downstream vicinity. Over seventy children and workers survived without injury by taking shelter in small interior rooms and bathrooms after receiving the warning, while portions of the roof collapsed over large open classrooms and the former sanctuary. The second area of higher-end EF2 damage was noted downstream at the Selma Country Club where several buildings had significant roof and exterior wall damage and there was a complete blow down of extremely large hardwood trees. Additional softwood trees were also snapped in and around adjacent streets.  As the tornado continued northeast, it entered the northern sections of downtown Selma. Much of the damage continued to consist of downed trees, some on homes, but several homes near the center of the track had entire roofs removed. Another notable area of damage was where Broad Street crossed the railroad tracks. A strip mall had much of its roof removed, and some of the X-braces in a metal building system failed, which from a structural engineering perspective was one of the more impressive damage indicators. Several older homes collapsed near the intersection of Minter Street and Saint Phillip Street, but they were built on brick pilings with open air underneath them, which kept them in the EF2 range. As the tornado exited downtown, it crossed Highway 14, where structure damage was noted with exterior walls that collapsed.|The tornado caused some significant damage at the Dallas County Jail on Selfield Road, with significant loss of roof material.

The tornado likely continued along rural forested areas east of Citronelle Road and Celeste Road that were inaccessible by the survey team based on radar velocity and tornado debris signatures. The survey team found evidence of snapped pine trees just southwest of Movico Loop Road North. The tornado strengthened as it crossed Movico Loop Road East causing significant softwood tree snaps and uprooting of large hardwood trees. A double wide manufactured home that was secured with straps rolled from its foundation and was destroyed just west of U.S. Highway 43. This iswhere the tornado reached peak intensity. The tornado then crossed U.S. Highway 43 just north of Cedar Creek Landing Road where a single wide manufactured home rolled from its foundation and was destroyed. The survey team found large oak trees snapped in a convergent pattern just to the north of where the manufactured home was destroyed. These damage indicators suggest that the tornado reached peak EF2 intensity with estimated winds around 125 mph and maximum width around 200 yards near the intersection of U.S Highway 43 and Cedar Creek Landing Road. Areal footage provided by Alabama Law Enforcement Agency indicates that the path narrowed with some residual softwood snaps into the forest north of Cedar Creek Landing Road before lifting.

The tornado crossed Highway 82 and strengthened as a manufactured home was rolled along Autauga County Road 40. Over the next two miles, the tornado rapidly strengthened as it approached the Old Kingston community, where EF3 damage began along County Road 43. At this location, at least three manufactured homes were obliterated with their frames thrown up to 100 yards. A pickup truck was sent airborne and landed 120 yards to the northeast, where a shallow crater was formed by its impact. The tornado became deadly as it impacted several homes along Sandy Ridge Road. The frame of a manufactured home at the western end of the road was thrown 250 yards to the north-northeast and came to rest in a field. Just downstream, several manufactured homes in a cluster were shredded and thrown considerable distances. Trees were snapped off relatively close to the ground and partially debarked. In total, five fatalities occurred along Sandy Ridge Road at three separate residences. Similar damage continued to the northeast along County Road 140, where two fatalities occurred in two separate residences at the eastern end of the road. At least five manufactured homes were blown away with their frames thrown considerable distances. Several vehicles were picked up and thrown, and one pickup truck had its cab separated from the bed.

This would likely have required around 100mph wind gusts to accomplish. The roofing material was quickly wrapped around the tornadic circulation and thrown back into the trees behind the building. In addition to this, inflow winds rapidly strengthened with a tree stand to the southwest having multiple trees snapped and uprooted facing towards the northeast, resulting in the tornadic circulation being approximately 230 yards here. A garage attached to the home just east of the farm building had 50% of its roofing material removed and likewise thrown towards the back.

The Houston county portion of the tornado is rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 130 mph. This tornado touched down in a swampy area, just east of Holmes Creek in northwest Jackson County. The tornado initially uprooted and snapped several softwood and hardwood trees, along Hickshill Road and in addition, it damaged an outbuilding there. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more hardwood and softwood trees along Piano Road. The first structure to be impacted by this tornado was a double-wide manufactured home on the northern side of Piano Road. Additional softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along Danford Bay Road. Tree damage continued along Orchid Road, Damascus Church Road and Layton Road as the tornado continued to progress northeastward. An outbuilding was damaged along Orchid Road, and a single-family home suffered significant roof damage along Layton Road. The tornado then destroyed two ninety foot, seventy-year-old concrete silos. Damage was found along the entire length of Everett Road which was composed of the snapping and uprooting of trees, along with damage to an outbuilding and a mobile home succumbing to window damage. More trees were damaged along Heislar Road and Peanut Road as the tornado continued its northeastward trek. A single-family home on Peanut Road suffered significant roof damage. When the tornado reached Shiloh Church Loop, a single-family home suffered significant roof damage. The tornado continued to move northeast across Highway 2 where more softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted and snapped. Most of the damage to this point is classified as EF-1. Before the tornado crossed into Alabama, it damaged the roof of a small business on US-231. After crossing into Houston County Alabama, the tornado produced a continuous swath of damage on either side of State Line Road all the way towards the city of Cottonwood. This is also consistent of EF-1 damage. The first instance of EF-2 damage was when the tornado approached Cottonwood proper, along Ramer Loop rolling a single-wide mobile home, destroying it, despite it being well strapped.   As the tornado moved through downtown Cottonwood, numerous small businesses sustained damage, ranging from blown out windows, roof damage and in one case the failure of the front-facing brick facade. Additional EF-2 damage occurred when the tornado removed the entire roof of a large two-story home. The tornado continued its northeastward jog, leaving Cottonwood proper, and commenced to destroy a two-story Moose Lodge that was composed of cinder-blocks resulting in another instance of EF-2 damage. The most significant tree damage noted on this survey occurred when the tornado paralleled Dyers Road, thus snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant damage along this northeastward path occurred on September Road where a double-wide home was completely destroyed, and resulted in one fatality. As the tornado continued to move northeast to across Whitaker Road and Creek Church Road, EF-1 tree damage was noted. The tornado caused mainly EF-0 damage to softwood and hardwood trees along Green Frog Road and Ed Tolar Road. One last structural damage occurred to a single-family home where it caused significant roof damage before lifting near the Chattahoochee River. In summary, while most damage was EF-1, there were instances of EF-2 damage with the max wind of 130 mph. In addition to the one fatality, there were also ten direct injuries from the tornado and an additional six indirect injuries during the response phase of the disaster, all in the Cottonwood area.

Aerial photographs indicated tree damage continued through a forested area between Mabson Abry Road and CR 33. The ground crew noted minor roof damage to a manufactured home near the intersection of Herman Strickland Road. Several more trees were snapped or uprooted further north along CR 33. Further east, more tree damage occurred on Herman Strickland Road where most of the structural damage was also noted. One home saw over 50% of its roofing material removed and a well-built outbuilding in the back yard had its doors blown in. The roof suffered some damage as well. Snapped trees were noted extending west into the woods. Further up the road, a home suffered the removal of its roof on the southern end of the house and the destruction of the back porch, much of which wound up on the roof. A large outbuilding in the back yard was shifted off its foundation. A neighboring home suffered similar damage to its house and large outbuilding. The tornado was at its strongest at this point with wind speeds estimated at 105 mph, which is EF-1 strength.

The tornado bent fencing while entering the property, then proceeded to shift dozens of 500 lb. storage tanks, tossing about 3 of them. Another metal trough tank was also tipped over and tossed. Then, after plowing through a chain-link fence, the tornado struck a light metal frame storage building. The bolts connecting the support columns to the foundation slab were sheared on three of the columns. The entire western flank of the building was collapsed in by the tornado, with metal framework bent as well. Some of the contents of the building were tossed out and strewn downwind several hundred yards found by on-site employees. As quickly as the tornado developed, it dissipated short of Saturn Drive, with no further identifiable damage found downwind.","Strong to severe thunderstorms, including miniature supercells, developed during the late afternoon and early evening hours before weakening and pushing east into Georgia after midnight.

The tornado path varied from very narrow at the beginning and end to about three-quarters of a mile wide at the widest location in Madison County.  Intensity varied from F0 intensity near both ends of the track to F4 at the strongest in several locations in Madison County.  Damage along the track was primarily in the F2 and F3 category.  Evidence in the damage as seen through an aerial survey indicated that the tornado was probably a multiple vortex with indications of at least two vortices within the main tornado funnel. 
The tornado began at 1633 CST in Limestone County crossing Interstate 65 and Highway 251 where the mobile home park was destroyed.  It reached the Limestone/Madison county line at 1650 CST.  The trek across Madison County saw the tornado move near the communities of Harvest, Meridianville, Buckhorn, and Fannings Crossing before moving into the rugged terrain of eastern Madison County.  The tornado crossed the Madison/Jackson county line at 1721 CST.  The tornado track was much weaker in Jackson County as it moved through rugged terrain affecting very few structures.  The track ended about 15 miles northwest of Scottsboro or a few miles west of the community of Hytop. 
Damage was the heaviest at a mobile home park about three miles northeast of Athens along Highway 251.  The only fatality that occurred in this tornado occurred at this mobile home park, and the person died later from injuries received in the tornado.  Twenty-six mobile homes were destroyed in Limestone County, 13 in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park.  Another 35 buildings were damaged or destroyed in Limestone County where damage was estimated to be $1.5 million.  About 9,500 
electric customers were without electricity.  A cow was also killed when a large tree fell on and crushed it. 
Another especially hard hit area was Anderson Hills subdivision in Madison County with houses ranging in price from $175,000 to $400,000.  This area of well-constructed dwellings was one of the locations where F4 damage was evident as well as indications of a multiple vortex structure.  In Anderson Hills, 21 houses were destroyed and 39 sustained major damage.  Damage across the rest of Madison County was less concentrated than in this one subdivision.  Over 10,000 Huntsville Utility Company customers were without power.

Traveling in a northeasterly direction the tornado moved from a rural, unpopulated area of the Black Warrior River into an area of homes south of Shelton State Community College. The tornado crossed SR 69 destroying a nearly complete shopping center which included a Winn Dixie store. East of SR 69 the tornado destroyed a number of houses and residential structures. 

As the tornado reached US 82 it destroyed a number of mobile homes where several deaths were reported. From US 82 the tornado continued northeasterly downing numerous trees and power lines and damaging residential structures. The tornado crossed I-20/59 just west of exit 77 where many trees were uprooted or snapped off. Minor damage occurred to the JVC manufacturing facility. 

At exit 77 a number of commercial structures including hotels, fast food restaurants, and truck stops sustained damage including a number of vehicles that were overturned. The tornado continued northeasterly for a couple of miles before dissipating rapidly. Ironically, the tornado dissipated as it moved into an open, unpopulated area. 

The tornado was spawned by a supercell thunderstorm that originated in Mississippi. This thunderstorm was responsible for additional tornado damage in St. Clair and Etowah counties.

Tuscaloosa EMA reported 11 fatalities with this tornado along with 144 injuries. Nine of the fatalities occurred in mobile homes, one in a vehicle, and one in a commercial building converted to residential use. Six of those killed were females and five were males.

The damage path began 7.9 miles east-southeast of Springville on the west side of US 411.  The path extended for about 4 tenths of a mile and was approximately 50 yards wide.  The area where the tornado touched downed was mostly open fields, however, a few trees were downed along with several large limbs and the tops of some trees.  Orientation to the downed trees was consistent with the presence of a weak rotation.  The tornado was rated an F0 on the Fujita Scale for tornado classification.

The tornado crossed into Walker County at 8:34 pm and traveled through sparsely populated areas of western Walker County. It crossed the interchange of US Highway 78 about 5.5 miles east-southeast of Carbon Hill, and became very strong as it traveled through the Saragossa area. It crossed State Roads 5, 195, and 257, before entering Winston County.

The tornado appeared to be at its most intense during the travel from US 78/SR 118 interchange across Saragossa and the areas near SR 5 and SR 195. Seven deaths occurred in this 10 mile stretch of the tornado track, along with an estimated 40 injuries.

At 9:03 pm the tornado crossed the extreme southeastern tip of Winston County, crossing a part of Smith Lake.

The tornado entered Cullman County at 9:08 pm, moving across portions of Smith Lake and across CR 222. Tornado intensity remained high during the first several miles after it entered Cullman County. Continuing northeast, it crossed Interstate 65 and US 31 just south of Cullman on the southside of the Cullman Golf Course.

The tornado seemed to be significantly less intense as it continued to travel northeasterly toward Holly Pond. Damage from just east of US 31 to just south of Holly Pond was not nearly as intense as it was west of Interstate 65. Traveling through mostly rural areas downing trees and powerlines, and damaging scattered structures along the way, the tornado finally ended just south-southeast of Holly Pond at 9:52 pm, 

This was the longest tornado of the outbreak, with a path length of 72.6 miles and a width of 1100 yards. It was the second F3 tornado of the day. Seven deaths were reported with the storm, all in Walker County, along with an estimated 45 injuries.

Structural damage details are difficult to report since reporting is based primarily on county and not by individual tornadoes.  Based on EMA and Red Cross data, structures damaged or destroyed were approximately 20 in Fayette County, 300 in Walker County, 5 in Winston County, and 164 in Cullman County.

This is also one of the longest tornadoes tracks in recent history. At 72.6 miles in length, this becomes the fourth longest tornado in Alabama since 1950.

The tornado appeared to be at its most intense during the travel from US 78/SR 118 interchange across Saragossa and the areas near SR 5 and SR 195. Seven deaths occurred in this 10 mile stretch of the tornado track, along with an estimated 40 injuries.

At 9:03 pm the tornado crossed the extreme southeastern tip of Winston County, crossing a part of Smith Lake.

The tornado entered Cullman County at 9:08 pm, moving across portions of Smith Lake and across CR 222. Tornado intensity remained high during the first several miles after it entered Cullman County. Continuing northeast, it crossed Interstate 65 and US 31 just south of Cullman on the southside of the Cullman Golf Course.

The tornado seemed to be significantly less intense as it continued to travel northeasterly toward Holly Pond. Damage from just east of US 31 to just south of Holly Pond was not nearly as intense as it was west of Interstate 65. Traveling through mostly rural areas downing trees and powerlines, and damaging scattered structures along the way, the tornado finally ended just south-southeast of Holly Pond at 9:52 pm, 

This was the longest tornado of the outbreak, with a path length of 72.6 miles and a width of 1100 yards. It was the second F3 tornado of the day. Seven deaths were reported with the storm, all in Walker County, along with an estimated 45 injuries.

Structural damage details are difficult to report since reporting is based primarily on county and not by individual tornadoes.  Based on EMA and Red Cross data, structures damaged or destroyed were approximately 20 in Fayette County, 300 in Walker County, 5 in Winston County, and 164 in Cullman County.

This is also one of the longest tornadoes tracks in recent history. At 72.6 miles in length, this becomes the fourth longest tornado in Alabama since 1950.

The tornado damaged one house significantly on the west side of US 43 just north of Chickasaw State Park and moved across US 43 downing several more trees. The tornado ended after crossing US 43 about 2.1 miles north of Providence on the east side of US 43.

The tornado was rated an F1 primarily due to the damage done to the house just north of Chickasaw State Park. The tornado path length was 2.5 miles with a width of about 80 yards. The tornado began around 8:36 pm and ended at approximately 8:40 pm.

The weak tornado was produced on the north side of a bow echo. Cyclonic rotation is often induced on the north side of the center of the bow. Bow echoes are known primarily for producing downbursts or straight line wind damage but also have the capability of producing weak tornadoes as apparently happened in this case.

The tornado first touched down in the White Plains community of Calhoun County, just west of the intersection of SR-9 and Cottaquilla Road. Damage at this location was light and scattered consisting mainly of downed trees and damaged roofs. From there, the tornado traveled east-northeast across SR-9 and County Road 55, where it caused considerable damage to greenhouses at a nursery business as well as chicken houses and other farm structures.

The tornado then moved through open country for about a mile and a half continuing to uproot trees before destroying a mobile home on Chinch Creek Road. From there, the tornado moved eastward into a wooded area of Cleburne County, across Rattlesnake Mountain, causing sporadic tree damage until it lifted about a half mile east of the Shoal Creek Picnic area.

The tornado destroyed two homes and damaged 21 others according to EMA and Red Cross damage assessments.  Alabama Power reported that 250 people were without power.

The tornado was rated an F1, mainly based on the amount of damage done to a mobile home on Chinch Creek Road. The tornado path length was about 8.9 miles.

No deaths and only three minor injuries were reported with this tornado. 

The tornado first touched down in the White Plains community of Calhoun County, just west of the intersection of SR-9 and Cottaquilla Road. Damage at this location was light and scattered consisting mainly of downed trees and damaged roofs. From there, the tornado traveled east-northeast across SR-9 and County Road 55, where it caused considerable damage to greenhouses at a nursery business as well as chicken houses and other farm structures.

The tornado then moved through open country for about a mile and a half continuing to uproot trees before destroying a mobile home on Chinch Creek Road. From there, the tornado moved eastward into a wooded area of Cleburne County, across Rattlesnake Mountain, causing sporadic tree damage until it lifted about a half mile east of the Shoal Creek Picnic area.

The tornado destroyed two homes and damaged 21 others according to EMA and Red Cross damage assessments.  Alabama Power reported that 250 people were without power.

The tornado was rated an F1, mainly based on the amount of damage done to a mobile home on Chinch Creek Road. The tornado path length was about 8.9 miles. The average damage path width directly associated with the tornado was 100-200 yards, although peripheral damage occurred up to a half mile south of center of the tornado path.

the Fujita Damage Scale with winds estimated around 75 miles an hour. The tornado touched down 
approximately 3 miles northeast of downtown Columbiana, just west of County Road 25 across the
train tracks. The tornado snapped off and uprooted numerous trees and knocked over several power
poles along its fairly short path. Some of the trees were several feet in diameter. Fallen trees
significantly damaged one home, produced minor damage to a few other homes, destroyed at least 4 
vehicles, and destroyed several outbuildings. The tornado crossed County Road 25 and headed eastward
across mainly rural farmland. The tornado ended near the intersection of Davis Road and County Road
5 where a garage sustained roof damage and one large tree was uprooted. The tornado damage path was
approximately 2.2 miles long and 150 yards wide at its widest point. The tornado started at 522 AM

in the form of scattered tree damage, from Vine Road just south of the Clay County line, east to near Highway 49.
The damage increased to F1 damage along Highway 49, especially to the southeast of the highway. There were 
several dozen trees snapped and uprooted, with many signs of convergence in the pattern of fallen trees. 
There were a few broken windows in two houses, and one house had its carport lifted up off most of its support
columns. In the same area of concentrated damage, four chicken houses sustained significant roof damage, and the
tin was blown down the tornado track for about 100 yards. The chicken houses were just north of the county line,

attached buildings. The tornado significantly damaged at least two of the walls, and the top of the building 
toppled over onto the adjacent buildings, causing more damage. Since the integrity of the building had already
been compromised, it was determined the damage was consistent with F0/F1 wind speeds. The tornado continued 
northeast across the Tallapoosa River and knocked down more trees near the intersection of County Road 33 and 
County Road 828, near Louina. The total damage path of the tornado was 17.1 miles long and 200 yards wide
