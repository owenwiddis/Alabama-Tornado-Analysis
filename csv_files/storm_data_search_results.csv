The girls father was working in a room that was attached to the home.  When the winds hit, the home was pulled out of the ground and rolled across a road and was completely demolished.  The room where the girls father was working was left standing.  Another "Double Wide" manufactured home, just west of the one that was destroyed, was picked up in the air,  blown across or through a clump of trees, and set down about 50 yards south of where it was tied down, in another clump of trees.  When viewing the home from a distance it appeared to have been purposely placed in the trees, with little outside damage visible.  However, when viewed form the inside, it looked as if an earthquake had hit it, with almost everything inside damaged.  Both of these manufactured homes were fairly new.  Both of the homes had the front tie downs pulled out of the ground and the anchors on the back of the homes snapped. The winds were estimated to be greater than 100 mph with the combination of the tornado and the intense downdraft from the "Bow Echo".  The tornado appeared to remain along the leading edge of the "Bow Echo" for a little over three miles.

The tornado traveled across southeastern Lamar County damaging or destroying a number of structures south and east of Kennedy.  The tornado traveled on a northeast track moving into Fayette County at 11:07 am.  Traveling northeast it went across western and northern sections of the city of Fayette doing serious damage to a number of structures.  From the city of Fayette the tornado traveled across mostly rural areas damaging occasional structures and downing numerous trees and power lines.  The tornado while still strong was weaker than it had been in southern Lamar County.  The tornado crossed into Walker County at 11:41 am a little south-southwest of Carbon Hill before ending.  

Total path length has been estimated at 38.9 miles with a Fujita-scale rating of F3.  The tornado began with F0 damage in Pickens County but strengthened to F3 intensity in southern Lamar County.  It weakened some as it moved across Fayette County where the Fujita rating was an F2.  Damage in Walker County was rated an F1 as the tornado dissipated.  The path was 300 yards wide in Lamar County but estimated to have decreased to about 90 yards wide across much of Fayette County.

Two people, a mother and her daughter, were killed in a double-wide mobile home in Lamar County just southwest of Kennedy and one person was injured.  No deaths or injuries were reported in Pickens, Fayette or Walker counties.

The tornado traveled northeasterly moving across County Road 44 and through the western sections of Chickasaw State Park. Where it first touched down, two mobile homes were damaged and a number of trees were either uprooted or snapped off.  The tornado damaged one house significantly on the west side of US 43 just north of Chickasaw State Park and moved across US 43 downing several more trees. The tornado ended after crossing US 43 about 2.1 miles north of Providence on the east side of US 43.

The tornado was rated an F1 primarily due to the damage done to the house just north of Chickasaw State Park. The tornado path length was 2.5 miles with a width of about 80 yards. The tornado began around 8:36 pm and ended at approximately 8:40 pm.

The weak tornado was produced on the north side of a bow echo. Cyclonic rotation is often induced on the north side of the center of the bow. Bow echoes are known primarily for producing downbursts or straight line wind damage but also have the capability of producing weak tornadoes as apparently happened in this case.

in the form of scattered tree damage, from Vine Road just south of the Clay County line, east to near Highway 49.
The damage increased to F1 damage along Highway 49, especially to the southeast of the highway. There were 
several dozen trees snapped and uprooted, with many signs of convergence in the pattern of fallen trees. 
There were a few broken windows in two houses, and one house had its carport lifted up off most of its support
columns. In the same area of concentrated damage, four chicken houses sustained significant roof damage, and the
tin was blown down the tornado track for about 100 yards. The chicken houses were just north of the county line,
in Clay County. The tornado damage path was about 200 yards wide at this point. This damage occurred around 618 AM
CDT. The tornado path continued to the east with more trees blown down along the Tallapoosa-Clay county line, 
including across Simpson Road and County Road 79. As it crossed County Road 79, around 627 AM CDT, the damage was
along the Tallapoosa-Randolph county line. The damage path entered extreme northwest Chambers County, around 630 AM,
along and north of Highway 22. At this point the tornado track ran parallel to Highway 22 all the way to Wadley,
on a northeast track. Three brick buildings were significantly damaged in downtown Wadley, about 100 yards north 
of the Highway 22/77 intersection, on the east side of Highway 77. The southern most building, built in 1925, 
sustained a fire several years ago and was condemned. The fire had gutted the two-story building, and only the 
four walls were left standing. There was no roof on this building and it was taller than the two adjacent and 
attached buildings. The tornado significantly damaged at least two of the walls, and the top of the building 
toppled over onto the adjacent buildings, causing more damage. Since the integrity of the building had already
been compromised, it was determined the damage was consistent with F0/F1 wind speeds. The tornado continued 
northeast across the Tallapoosa River and knocked down more trees near the intersection of County Road 33 and 
County Road 828, near Louina. The total damage path of the tornado was 17.1 miles long and 200 yards wide
at its widest point. For purposes of this write-up, the tornado occurred in two counties at the same time because 
its placement was directly on the county lines.
