One had some minor damage to some of the siding and gutters. The other had uplift of some sections of the roof from both the house and a nearby shed. Damage at this location was consistent with estimated peak 3-second wind gusts of around 100 mph based on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Some sporadic tree damage was noted to the northeast of Thelma Road near some farm fields, and it seems likely that the tornado was then in occasional contact with the ground for a little over a mile with only some light tree damage noted.

Multiple hardwood trees were snapped at the beginning of the tornado track. From there, the tornado damaged several mobile homes on Roberts Catfish Lane. One of the mobile homes rolled 45-50 yards to the northeast after snapping all 6 of the tie-downs that anchored the home. The unit was mostly destroyed with the frame of the structure still largely intact. The second mobile home at this location separated from its porch and was shifted off its foundation about 10 feet. A wooden tin carport structure housing lawn and farm equipment was partially destroyed, with pieces of the wood embedded in the ground around the mobile homes. A small sedan parked at the second mobile home was lifted and had the front end embedded briefly in the ground, tearing off the front bumper, which was found 10 feet away. debris from these buildings was found half a mile to the northeast from this location at the next area of damage surveyed. Path width at this location was about 50 yards.||About half a mile northeast, just west of interstate 65 on Bethel Circle Northeast, widespread tree damage was surveyed. Large hardwood trees about 2 feet in diameter were found snapped, sheared and twisted off about 10-15 feet from their bases. Multiple trees had the bark twisted off and strewn about the forest. Of the few homes that were within the tree damage area, only minor damage was noted to a couple of the houses. Most of this damage was from siding being blown off or from trees directly clipping the edge of a roof as they fell. The vast majority of the tree damage at this location was on property along Village Branch Cree behind the homes. Path width at this location was about 200 yards.||The tornado appeared to lift briefly before setting down again along Bethel Road near the intersection with Spring Valley Road, just east of Interstate 65. Several trees were uprooted at the Walnut Grove Baptist Church, and several gravestones were pushed over or broken. Numerous pine trees were snapped in a clear, coherent path as the tornado continued to the northeast.||Tree damage became more consistent and widespread along Shoal Creek Road and White Oak Drive. Hundreds of softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted in this general area, and there was some minor structural damage to a few single family homes. The tree damage was more widespread as the tornado moved into the Autumn Wood Trail area. Trees fell onto a single family home and damaged it.||The most significant structural damage occurred near the intersection of Thompson Lane and Peach Orchard Road. IN this area, multiple sheds were completely destroyed and most of the shingles on the roof of a single family home were torna off. Once again, numerous pine trees were snapped. The tornado appeared to weaken slightly as it moved towards Uper River Road. There was some modest tree damage in a field east of Thomson Lane, and many of the shingles on the roof of a single family home were damaged or removed.||The tornado continued northeast to Turkey Mountain, Road, where it snapped several more trees and pushed a double-wide mobile home off its piers and damage the roof. Based on damage viewed from Turkey Mountain Road, it is believed that the tornado continued to near the Tennessee River.","Supercell and multi-cell cluster thunderstorms affected much of the Tennessee Valley in advance of a strong cold front during the late afternoon and evening hours of the 31st.

The tornado then traveled northeast with a long swath of damage centered along a track generally between Interstate 20/59 and Highway 11. Aside from continued uprooting of trees and downing of limbs, the first notable damage occurred just west of Western Hills Mall, where there was hefty damage to an Express Oil Change, Alabama ABC store, and mini strip mall, along Dr. M.L.K. Boulevard. Damage at this location was likely the result of a short-lived, concentrated vortex, with a track around 300 yards in length and EF1 intensity. Beyond this point, damage fell into EF0 range.||The tornado continued knocking down trees as it moved northeast, with some trees falling onto homes, resulting in severe roof damage. Tornadic winds also caused minor to moderate roof damage ranging from missing shingles to sections of roof damaged or blown off, especially in neighborhoods adjacent to Miles College (to the south and northeast). Given a noticeable increase in damage density, it is possible that the tornado briefly intensified in this area, over the course of roughly a 700 yard path. While there was an obvious increase in the amount of uprooted trees, there was a large contribution from shallow root systems and especially saturated soil conditions; thus, given a lack of notable wind-driven damage to homes (which held in EF0, characteristic of shingle and roof trim damage), the overall damage pattern did not tip the scale for a small corridor of EF1 rating.||Next, the tornado neared and crossed Interstate 20/59 where the extent of damage backed off, though some minor structural damage done to the Tire Tech car bay, and Freeway Honda.

Two tornadoes touched down across inland portions of the Florida Panhandle before sunrise, followed by persistent heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding at several river sites.  One of the tornadoes clipped far southern Houston county.  As an upper level trough dug southward across the western and central U.S., southerly flow drew moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the tri-state area over the weekend. Upper air soundings measured this increased moisture with precipitable water values around 1.5 inches on Sunday, well above the 90th percentile and a record for the 12z February 11 sounding, although the record for that date and time are below the average max for this time of year. With a cold front and upper level trough west of the area, the persistent deep layer moisture helped to create a favorable set-up for high rainfall amounts.  This wet pattern resulted in copious amounts of rainfall across the tri-state region. The highest rainfall amounts were across the Florida Panhandle where 8 to 10 inches fell with localized areas receiving more than 10 inches across coastal Walton and Bay counties. The highest observed rainfall total was in Walton County, where a 48-hour rainfall total of 11.45 inches was recorded.

Significant tree damage was noted along Alabama Highway 127 and Veto Road north of Elkmont, where hundreds of trees were snapped or uprooted. It was in this area where the tornado reached its maximum path width of 350 yards. The tornado continued east-northeast, narrowly missing the Saturn I rocket at the Alabama Welcome Center on Interstate 65. Tree damage continued on Hardiman Lane east of I-65, but roof damage also occurred to single-family homes. Similar damage was observed on Puckett Lane and Oak Grove Road. There is evidence (both from radar and ground surveys) to suggest that the tornado had multiple vortices between Oak Grove Road and Valley Drive, as there are two distinct damage paths in this area. Again, much of the damage was to trees and roofs of single-family and manufactured homes, as well as small sheds and barns. The most severe damage by far occurred along Alabama Highway 251 and Gatlin Road, where one or two houses had their roofs and roofing structures almost completely torn off, and several more had most of their shingles torn off. Fortunately the residents had taken shelter in a nearby basement and none were injured.
