In the Ruth community, Mount Oak and Frontier Roads were hardest hit where a cinder block/cement home was nearly wiped clean.  Debris from a home on Frontier Road was thrown 50 to 100 yards away.  A family of 9 was in this house and 5 were killed. A trailer was missing and a metal-bolted garage was wiped clean of its foundation.  Along Frontier Road, a large brick home was nearly wiped clean off its foundation with several large trees ripped out of the ground and missing.  Further northeast along the path, along Walnut Ridge, a one-story home was severely damaged with the roof missing and a trailer that was tossed into a tree.  Several concrete power poles were bent over as the tornado crossed U.S. Highway 231, some bent at the base.  One the east side of Highway 231, a gas station building was completely demolished and two gas pumps were ripped from the ground and missing. The canopy over the pumps remained mostly intact.||The tornado continued toward Union Grove.  The degree of damage weakened somewhat but several homes had significant damage where the top stories and roofs were destroyed and the external walls had collapsed.  Along County Road 240, a double-wide manufactured home was destroyed and a large garage collapsed but the well-built roof remained intact.||The tornado significantly weakened as it crossed the Tennessee River.  On the other side of the river, the tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees as it crossed Walker Road and just across U.S. Highway 431 before lifting just northeast of Highway 431.","A powerful storm system roared across the Southeast United States on Wednesday, April 27, 2011.

Within a two mile corridor of either side of the railroad tracks the damage was significant. Within this corridor, several well constructed houses were destroyed.  Along Bonner Street, multiple block homes were leveled to the ground with the block foundations destroyed.  A twenty-five foot section of pavement was sucked up and scattered. Chunks of the pavement were found in a home over 1/3 of a mile down the road. The damage in this area was consistent with EF-5 damage. ||In addition, at least three churches along the path sustained significant damage.   One church in Phil Campbell was completely destroyed with only the slab remaining.||Multiple mobile homes throughout the path were completely destroyed, and their mangled frames were tossed 25 to 50 yards.  Cars were tossed and destroyed throughout the path of the tornado, with one car wrapped around a debarked tree in Phil Campbell.   All along the path length, thousands of hardwood and softwood trees were snapped.  Hundreds of trees were also debarked and twisted, and had only stubs of the largest branches remaining.  EF-5 damage continued similarly northeast from Phil Campbell, roughly along County Roads 81 and 82 toward the community of Oak Grove.||In Oak Grove, the tornado may have reached a relative maximum in intensity well into the EF-5 category as the damage was slightly more intense and the path width was at a maximum of greater than one mile.  A large swath of complete devastation was noted in Oak Grove along County Roads 38 and Smith Lane.  A large well-constructed home with extensive anchoring was razed with debris carried well away from the site.  A Corvette sports car was mangled and thrown 641 feet (measured). A block home next door was also disintegrated.  Along Smith Lane a block home was wiped out and the only remains of a nearby chicken house was a small piece of a metal truss.

Along this line, the tornado passed through Fyffe, Rainsville, Sylvania, and eventually into northern DeKalb County south of the Cartersville community, killing 25 people. On the first day of surveys, the survey team noticed initial damage in the Lakeview community where the path width was generally around 50 yards.  This initial damage included mostly felled and snapped trees and structural damage to small buildings.  Extensive damage was noted especially in Rainsville and Sylvania where the path width was estimated to over 1/2 mile wide.  Damage in Rainsville included houses that were completely removed from foundations, with debris scattered for about one mile.  Near this location, trees were debarked and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed, with debris strewn for about a mile downstream.||A narrow corridor of intense damage extended from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road (also known as County Road 180), extending toward County Road 514.

A supporting large cement stone pillar was ripped completely out of the ground.  Another home along Skaggs Road was also leveled completely to the ground. The NOAA overflight showed significant ground scarring in this area and a walk through the nearby fields showed large pot marks and other sections of disturbed ground. ||Slightly northeast along Lingerfeldt Road, numerous homes were leveled completely to their foundation with vehicles and debris strewn for hundreds of feet.  Overhead photos and follow-up visual confirmation revealed a mangled vehicle tossed well into a ravine and resting up in the remainder of trees.  At  1608 Lingerfeldt Road/County Road 180, a large two story brick home was completely obliterated with several of the supporting anchors ripped of the ground.  A concrete porch was ripped off with pieces strewn up to 150 yards.  A section of the asphalt driveway was pulled up.  In addition, an anchored liberty safe weighing 800 pounds was pulled off its anchorage and thrown into a wooded area 600 feet away.  When found, the safe's door had been ripped open and completely off.  A large pick-up truck at this residence was found mangled in pieces over 250 yards away in the same wooded area.  The residents of the home survived in a nearby storm pit.  Of note, the storm pit was partially exposed by the tornado with dirt being sucked up and pulled away around the opening.  Next door, a mobile home was completely disintegrated.  The residents of the mobile there also survived in a storm pit.  The section of damage from Skaggs Road to Lingerfeldt Road near the intersection with Crow Lane was deemed to be EF-5 intensity.   Severe damage with high end EF-4 damage was noted in a corridor from County Road 515 through a neighborhood along County Road 441.  In the east and south ends of the neighborhood, many one and two story homes were leveled to their foundation with debris scattered some distance.  Several cars were thrown a large distance in this area.  There was evidence of ground scarring as well as some sidewalk pavement pulled up in this location.  However, some of the homes in this area appeared to be pushed off their foundation initially with limited anchorage. ||In the Sylvania community, similar situation occurred with houses completely removed from foundations and debris blown far downstream.  Some of these houses were connected to their foundations with anchor bolts and foundation straps, indicating a stronger construction of the homes. ||Tornado damage continued from the Blake community, intersecting County Road 27, running parallel between State Highway 75 and Interstate 59 through Henager, Ider, to south of Cartersville.  ||In the Blake community, the tornado path width was estimated to be one half to three quarters of a mile.

All exterior and interior walls of several homes were completely destroyed with partial block and mortar foundations remaining.  In one instance, a concrete slab that served as a porch was displaced a few feet and broken in half.  Some hardwood trees in the area were stripped with no stubs of any branches remaining and were partially debarked.  The Mountain View Baptist Church sustained significant damage.  An old, one-story portion of the church dating back to 1902 and constructed of a brick and mortar exterior on wood frame walls was completely destroyed.  A recent two-story addition to the church was constructed in 2004 and consisting of similar building materials was partially destroyed, with most exterior walls and nearly all interior walls fallen.
