An unanchored manufactured home next door was completely destroyed with the remaining contents blown across the road and scattered over 100 yards. A vehicle at this residence was rolled and sustained damage. The tornado continued to move rather slowly off to the northeast causing additional trees to fall. Several additional homes along the path sustained structural damage of mainly roof uplift and loss of shingles. Another manufactured home with some anchoring was rolled and blown apart on the north side of State Road 14. There were two occupants inside the home who were sheltering. They survived and crawled out with minor injuries. Farther northeast along State Road 14, a two story home sustained structural damage along with additional damage from falling trees. They were very large hardwood trees snapped near the base. A motorist trying to evade the tornado attempted to take shelter here and narrowly missed a large falling tree. At this point the tornado was likely at its widest reaching nearly 1000 yards.

The damage consisted of mainly uprooted trees with some trunks that were snapped. There were also several manufactured homes that sustained roof and some foundation damage. As the tornado continued along Highway 22, additional tree damage was observed as it neared the southwestern sections of Selma.|The tornado quickly intensified as it entered the city limits of Selma, nearly parallel to Highway 22 and West Dallas Avenue. The overall length and damage width in the densely populated neighborhoods had devastating impacts to the city. Many hardwood trees were uprooted and softwood trees were snapped, many onto homes. Most of the softwood trees were snapped about halfway up on the trunks. A daycare center on West Dallas Avenue and Cooper Drive sustained heavy roof and exterior wall damage which was consistent with the higher-end EF2 wind speeds. Some debris rowing was also noted in the downstream vicinity. Over seventy children and workers survived without injury by taking shelter in small interior rooms and bathrooms after receiving the warning, while portions of the roof collapsed over large open classrooms and the former sanctuary. The second area of higher-end EF2 damage was noted downstream at the Selma Country Club where several buildings had significant roof and exterior wall damage and there was a complete blow down of extremely large hardwood trees. Additional softwood trees were also snapped in and around adjacent streets.  As the tornado continued northeast, it entered the northern sections of downtown Selma. Much of the damage continued to consist of downed trees, some on homes, but several homes near the center of the track had entire roofs removed. Another notable area of damage was where Broad Street crossed the railroad tracks. A strip mall had much of its roof removed, and some of the X-braces in a metal building system failed, which from a structural engineering perspective was one of the more impressive damage indicators. Several older homes collapsed near the intersection of Minter Street and Saint Phillip Street, but they were built on brick pilings with open air underneath them, which kept them in the EF2 range.

The tornado crossed the other end of a curving Singletary Road, snapping and uprooting more trees. Near the intersection of Singletary Road and W. Washington St., the tornado toppled several concrete memorial monuments. After crossing Washington St. The tornado toppled trees on Marianna Drive and Alberta Drive. Finally, the tornado snapped or uprooted several trees in the vicinity of a cemetery on East Washington St. before lifting short of Eufaula Highway. Damage along the entire path was estimated to be consistent with EF-1 damage with maximum sustained winds around 100 mph.","The middle part of June was unusually stormy across the area. Numerous rounds of strong to severe storms impacted the region with multiple squall lines that produced severe winds as well as supercells that produced large hail and tornadoes.  Heavy rain also occurred over a multi-day period, which saturated the ground and led to some instances of flash flooding.  ||The synoptic pattern featured well above average 250 mb zonal wind anomalies, which were traceable back to an active subtropical jet stream.  Greater than average instability was also present, in part due to anomalously warm Gulf of Mexico SSTs.  This combination of above average shear from the active subtropical jet and above average instability from the warmer than average SSTs provided a synoptic environment favorable for severe weather as upper level shortwaves moving through the area.

It was here that the first notable damage occurred. A farm building had its entire roof removed which was reinforced with hurricane straps. This would likely have required around 100mph wind gusts to accomplish. The roofing material was quickly wrapped around the tornadic circulation and thrown back into the trees behind the building. In addition to this, inflow winds rapidly strengthened with a tree stand to the southwest having multiple trees snapped and uprooted facing towards the northeast, resulting in the tornadic circulation being approximately 230 yards here. A garage attached to the home just east of the farm building had 50% of its roofing material removed and likewise thrown towards the back. A small outbuilding at this location was destroyed with debris thrown across the field. The tornado continued across the field into an area of forest where drone footage revealed multiple snaps and uproots along a narrow corridor around 100 yards wide. Based on Digital Globe Worldview satellite imagery the details of what happened for the rest of the tornado path have become clearer. The tornado turned to the south where it crossed a small pond to the southwest of a home uprooting a tree facing north. Sporadic uproots are visible on satellite imagery to the west of a large field within the forest, generally consisting of high end EF0 wind speeds. The tornado continued to the south-southeast through the forest, eventually intensifying notably west of Magnolia Springs Highway where numerous uproots are noted. This is where the tornado likely peaked in intensity with at least 100mph winds. The tornado may have continued southeast from here, but cloud cover in the area prevented visibility of the damage path in this area.

The Houston county portion of the tornado is rated EF2 with max winds estimated at 130 mph. This tornado touched down in a swampy area, just east of Holmes Creek in northwest Jackson County. The tornado initially uprooted and snapped several softwood and hardwood trees, along Hickshill Road and in addition, it damaged an outbuilding there. The tornado continued northeast, damaging more hardwood and softwood trees along Piano Road. The first structure to be impacted by this tornado was a double-wide manufactured home on the northern side of Piano Road. Additional softwood and hardwood trees were snapped and uprooted along Danford Bay Road. Tree damage continued along Orchid Road, Damascus Church Road and Layton Road as the tornado continued to progress northeastward. An outbuilding was damaged along Orchid Road, and a single-family home suffered significant roof damage along Layton Road. The tornado then destroyed two ninety foot, seventy-year-old concrete silos. Damage was found along the entire length of Everett Road which was composed of the snapping and uprooting of trees, along with damage to an outbuilding and a mobile home succumbing to window damage. More trees were damaged along Heislar Road and Peanut Road as the tornado continued its northeastward trek. A single-family home on Peanut Road suffered significant roof damage. When the tornado reached Shiloh Church Loop, a single-family home suffered significant roof damage. The tornado continued to move northeast across Highway 2 where more softwood and hardwood trees were uprooted and snapped. Most of the damage to this point is classified as EF-1. Before the tornado crossed into Alabama, it damaged the roof of a small business on US-231. After crossing into Houston County Alabama, the tornado produced a continuous swath of damage on either side of State Line Road all the way towards the city of Cottonwood. This is also consistent of EF-1 damage. The first instance of EF-2 damage was when the tornado approached Cottonwood proper, along Ramer Loop rolling a single-wide mobile home, destroying it, despite it being well strapped.   As the tornado moved through downtown Cottonwood, numerous small businesses sustained damage, ranging from blown out windows, roof damage and in one case the failure of the front-facing brick facade. Additional EF-2 damage occurred when the tornado removed the entire roof of a large two-story home. The tornado continued its northeastward jog, leaving Cottonwood proper, and commenced to destroy a two-story Moose Lodge that was composed of cinder-blocks resulting in another instance of EF-2 damage. The most significant tree damage noted on this survey occurred when the tornado paralleled Dyers Road, thus snapping numerous hardwood and softwood trees. The most significant damage along this northeastward path occurred on September Road where a double-wide home was completely destroyed, and resulted in one fatality. As the tornado continued to move northeast to across Whitaker Road and Creek Church Road, EF-1 tree damage was noted. The tornado caused mainly EF-0 damage to softwood and hardwood trees along Green Frog Road and Ed Tolar Road. One last structural damage occurred to a single-family home where it caused significant roof damage before lifting near the Chattahoochee River. In summary, while most damage was EF-1, there were instances of EF-2 damage with the max wind of 130 mph. In addition to the one fatality, there were also ten direct injuries from the tornado and an additional six indirect injuries during the response phase of the disaster, all in the Cottonwood area.

Aerial photographs indicated tree damage continued through a forested area between Mabson Abry Road and CR 33. The ground crew noted minor roof damage to a manufactured home near the intersection of Herman Strickland Road. Several more trees were snapped or uprooted further north along CR 33. Further east, more tree damage occurred on Herman Strickland Road where most of the structural damage was also noted. One home saw over 50% of its roofing material removed and a well-built outbuilding in the back yard had its doors blown in. The roof suffered some damage as well. Snapped trees were noted extending west into the woods. Further up the road, a home suffered the removal of its roof on the southern end of the house and the destruction of the back porch, much of which wound up on the roof. A large outbuilding in the back yard was shifted off its foundation. A neighboring home suffered similar damage to its house and large outbuilding.

At this location, part of a service station canopy was removed. Fences were knocked down on adjacent streets in this area. More softwood trees were snapped or uprooted as the tornado moved through residential areas approaching Muscle Shoals High School. On school property, several trees were snapped, some near the base, but the building itself didn't sustain any damage. There were other sporadic trees randomly snapped south of this location along portions of Washington Drive and Colorado Avenue, but this wind damage was determined to be strong winds in the rear flank downdraft of the occluding tornadic circulation.

Additional indicators of tree damage were found near the intersection of CR 53 and CR 147. The tornado then progressed along Highway 117 into Stevenson, where trees were observed to be uprooted or had large branches broken. As the primary damage indicators were related to trees, and considering the above-average rainfall experienced in May, the estimated wind speeds were slightly reduced to account for highly saturated ground conditions.","An upper level disturbance moving east into northern Alabama and southern middle Tennessee (north of a slow moving frontal boundary edge north from central Alabama) interacted with an unstable atmosphere during the early to mid afternoon hours to produce a line of strong to severe thunderstorms that exited in Georgia between 6 and 7 PM. This line of storms produced damaging winds in portions of northern Alabama and a tornado in the Cave Springs area of Jackson county.||An additional line of strong to severe thunderstorms developed as the frontal boundary moved north into northern Alabama later in the evening before exiting the area after midnight. This line of storms produced sporadic damaging winds, particularly in Lawrence county and a few instances of large hail. Some aerial flooding occurred as well in portions of DeKalb county.",479

The tornado bent fencing while entering the property, then proceeded to shift dozens of 500 lb. storage tanks, tossing about 3 of them. Another metal trough tank was also tipped over and tossed. Then, after plowing through a chain-link fence, the tornado struck a light metal frame storage building. The bolts connecting the support columns to the foundation slab were sheared on three of the columns. The entire western flank of the building was collapsed in by the tornado, with metal framework bent as well. Some of the contents of the building were tossed out and strewn downwind several hundred yards found by on-site employees. As quickly as the tornado developed, it dissipated short of Saturn Drive, with no further identifiable damage found downwind.","Strong to severe thunderstorms, including miniature supercells, developed during the late afternoon and early evening hours before weakening and pushing east into Georgia after midnight. The thunderstorms produced damaging winds and a tornado in north central portions of Alabama. Isolated flash flooding occurred as well.",480
